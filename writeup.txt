## Getting Familiar with ROS Assignment
### Computational Robotics Class
#### Members: Antonnia Elsen, Claire Keum, Thomas Nattestad 

##### Rosbag
1. How might rosbag fit into a debugging process as you work on projects in this class?
	* Can replay the scenario where it had an error situation 
	* Collects data that we can reference.

2. Are there any obvious shortcomings of rosbag as a debugging tool?
	* Matching up with the actual data(location) might not be precise.

##### TF
1. Does the new behavior make sense?
	* We were able to visualize the robot's movement based on its starting point.
